# Untitled Runner Game
This is a "dream" project of mine, to make a game much in the same style of the classic sonic games. I
also would like this game to have light problem solving.

## Current Development State
Nondemonstrable (Stage 1/4)

The demonstrable stage will look like:
- one level (with multi sub levels)
    * involves two introductory puzzles (inside areas)
    * speed/platform segment lasting ~40 seconds (outside area)
- game is presented with intro texts, instructing on basic controls only
- level has to reasonably well decorated
    * flowers/bushes
    * waterfalls
    * two layers in background + clouds
    * vines from cielings
    * indoors can be stoney dungeons

In anycase we'll have to see where I go art wise.
